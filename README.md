# About-me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi ,I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 
I have extensive experience in pattern recognition, preprocessing techniques, and machine learning, including deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. I have developed a strong foundation in these areas. My work has involved applying image processing techniques, such as filtering and feature extraction, to enhance data analysis and interpretation.
Currently, I am focused on advancing my skills in neural networks, exploring architectures such as CNNs and RNNs to tackle complex problems in computer vision and natural language processing.
